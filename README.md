# Open-Gamma
Open-Source implementation of the Gamma function (and Factorial) for Java (float datatype) 

Use the gamma function in the OGamma class to calculate gamma(x) for x is any real number except for non-positive integers. The factorial function only allows positive real numbers. You can enter any number between about -35 and +35.

In order to be able to evaluate the gamma/factorial function of much larger numbers use the logGamma and logFactorial functions. Note, that they currently only take positive inputs.
